Google Case Study

The Need for Speed: measuring the importance of loading times

Does time fly, or does time stand still?
Basis used innovative new approaches, cutting-edge tech, and a solid grounding in temporal illusions to answer a profound research question for Google.

Challenge
How important is speed? At least as far as mobile websites go, we can guess it’s pretty important. People are impatient, distractible, and often multi-tasking – mobile web pages need to work hard to keep up. 

But Google wanted to quantify the importance of speed on the mobile web. A knotty, harder-than-it-first-appears research challenge, because how people perceive time isn’t constant: sometimes it flies, and sometimes it stands still.

From Vierodt’s law to the Kappa effect, there’s a wealth of academic literature on temporal illusions, and the disconnect between the objective passage of time and our subjective experience of it. To fully understand the importance of speed, we knew we needed an accurate measure of both.

Approach
To get to the answer, we designed an innovative, cutting-edge approach: 

Passively monitoring organic mobile web behaviour across a quant-scale sample

Building out the technical capabilities to measure actual loading speeds when relevant sites were visited

Collecting in-the-moment survey data immediately after each visit, to measure perceptions about the loading experience

We were able to directly compare the real, empirically-observed experience of time (the actual loading speeds of a web page) with human perception of it (survey data on how quickly the web page was perceived to have loaded, and the resulting attitudinal and behavioural outcomes).

Impact
The research delivered a real splash, which was one the chief objectives for Google: 

More than 2,000 people have been trained on the findings and implications, both inside and outside of Google

Videos documenting the research have generated more than 30,000 views

White papers and articles featuring the research have also been viewed more than 30,000 times

Most importantly, through the application of a considered, bespoke research design and innovative, cutting-edge research technology it provided an intelligent answer to an open, nebulous question: how important is speed, really?

GSMA Case Study

The Privacy Paradox: researching data protection law in Sub-Saharan Africa

Overcoming literacy barriers to tackle technical subject matter, debunk myths, and build a framework for engaging with digital rights and privacy in Ghana, Rwanda, Zambia and Mozambique.

Challenge
Global telecoms trade body, the GSMA, asked us to explore:

How do legal frameworks around data protection impact trust in institutions, and willingness to engage with digital services in developing markets?

This required us to tackle technical, complex subject matter with diverse audiences and language groups, including those with low digital and written literacy.

Privacy is also a topic where claimed attitudes do not match actual behaviour: we all know privacy is important, but who actually reads the Terms and Conditions?

Approach
A hybrid methodology incorporating expert & academic interviews, end-user groups & interviews, and a quantitative survey.

With such a nuanced and complex topic, we knew that a qualitative approach would be central. However, we also needed to make robust comparisons between markets with different legal frameworks in place. 

We anchored our questioning around real-world behaviours, rather than abstract concepts: using social media, or accessing other services, rather than “sharing your data”.

This showed us that while many people claim to be security-conscious, most are freely sharing their information day-to-day – as long as there is something in it for them.

Impact
This research was published by the GSMA and has gone on to inform the way they engage with policymakers and mobile network operators across the region. 

The impact of data protection law on attitudes is subtle: the vast majority simply do not know enough about these laws.

And the relationship between legal protection, digital literacy and trust is paradoxical. The least digitally savvy were in markets with weak legal frameworks, and yet were often the most trusting; while the most digitally informed and best protected were typically the most cautious and cynical.
